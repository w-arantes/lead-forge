```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Lead Forge follows **Clean Architecture** principles with a domain-driven design approach:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/          # React components (UI layer)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ domain/             # Business logic and domain models
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/         # TypeScript interfaces and types
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ schemas/        # Zod validation schemas
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ infra/          # Infrastructure (store, storage)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ usecases/       # Business use cases
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/              # Custom React hooks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/                # Utility functions and helpers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/              # Page components
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ styles/             # Global styles and Tailwind config
```

### **Key Design Principles**

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between UI, business logic, and data
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module has one reason to change
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients depend only on interfaces they use

## üìä Data Models

### Lead
```typescript
interface Lead {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  company: string;
  email: string;
  source: LeadSource;
  score: number;
  status: LeadStatus;
  createdAt: string;
  lastContacted?: string;
  convertedAt?: string;
}
```

### Opportunity
```typescript
interface Opportunity {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  stage: OpportunityStage;
  amount?: number;
  accountName: string;
  convertedFrom: string;
  convertedAt: string;
}
```
